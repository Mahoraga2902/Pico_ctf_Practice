The challenge gaves us a file called "logs.txt".

The file seems corrupted as when i opened it, it was filled with gibberish texts.

I went to the hint and found out that i had to decode the file text which was in base64 encoding, and get the image.

So I fired up my Terminal,

After i upload the file in that website, I found out that the authors name is is in a Base64 format.

I copied the text and went to Chatgpt to decrypt it, I got the FLAG!!!!!!!
