## Solution

The challenge gaves us a file called "logs.txt".

The file seems corrupted as when i opened it, it was filled with gibberish texts.

I went to the hint and found out that i had to decode the file text which was in base64 encoding, and get the image.

So I fired up my Terminal, decoded the file from its base64 format and saved it as Output12.jpg

After I opend the image, I saw a string of numbers and texts written just below the image.

I copied the text and went to Chatgpt to decrypt it, I got the FLAG!!!!!!!
